/**
 * Move [temp] onto this file, replacing it if it already exists.
 *
 * **Do not use `File.renameTo` for this.** Its behaviour when the destination exists is
 * platform-dependent, and the platforms disagree in exactly the way that hides the bug during
 * development: POSIX `rename(2)` replaces the target, so macOS and Linux work, while Win32
 * `MoveFile` fails with `ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS`, so Windows silently stops overwriting anything
 * after the first write. That cost the browser its favicons on Windows for as long as the cache
 * had an entry — see [ai.rever.boss.cache.FaviconCache].
 *
 * `Files.move` with `REPLACE_EXISTING` is the portable form: on Windows it maps to `MoveFileEx`
 * with `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`. `ATOMIC_MOVE` is requested first because it additionally rules
 * out a torn destination, and is retried without when the move would cross a volume — the only
 * case that raises `AtomicMoveNotSupportedException`. Both callers create their temp file as a
 * sibling of the target, so that fallback should never fire; it is there for a caller that does
 * not. Any other refusal is a plain `IOException` and propagates.
 *
 * @throws IOException if the file could not be replaced.

 * last move wins.
 *
 * Shared by everything that persists small state files, including the workspace
 * layout written on shutdown; `grep atomicWriteText` for the current set rather
 * than trusting a list here, which has gone stale once already. Callers
 * previously open-coded this dance with a FIXED temp name, which concurrent
 * writers could clobber.
 *
 * The parent directory is verified before use: a symlinked parent (or one swapped for a
 * symlink between the check and the move) would redirect both the temp file and the
 * destination wherever the link points, so the write refuses one outright and otherwise
 * runs against the resolved real path.

 * the directory they resolve to right now - a later swap of the declared path cannot
 * redirect a write that no longer goes through it. Where the filesystem reports a POSIX
 * owner, the directory must also belong to the user running this process.
 *
 * Closing the last sliver of the swap race - a link landing between the refusal check and
 * the resolve - needs a held directory fd (O_NOFOLLOW/openat), which java.nio does not
 * expose; the post-resolve re-check below shrinks that window to the minimum the API
 * allows rather than pretending it is closed.
